            "target_market": "The primary target market is the UK student housing market, encompassing both students/graduates seeking accommodation and landlords/letting agents managing student properties. A secondary market includes parents or guardians assisting students in finding suitable housing.",
            "market_size": "The UK student accommodation market is substantial. According to various reports, the total number of students in higher education in the UK is significant (over 2.7 million in 2022/23, according to HESA). The private student accommodation (PSA) sector is a multi-billion pound industry. Exact figures for the total addressable market size for a platform like Hybr are difficult to pinpoint precisely without proprietary market research, but the market is large and growing due to increasing student populations and the demand for quality housing. The market is estimated to be worth billions of pounds annually, considering rent payments, management fees, and related services.",
            "growth_potential": "The market demonstrates strong growth potential. Factors driving this include: 1) Increasing student enrollment in UK universities, particularly international students. 2) A growing preference for purpose-built student accommodation (PBSA) offering better amenities and security. 3) The increasing demand for digital solutions in property management and tenant acquisition. 4) The potential for expansion into related markets such as graduate housing and professional rentals. 5) An increase in the number of students from overseas, and thus a growth in demand for student housing. The increasing pressure on universities to meet housing needs further contributes to the growth potential.",
