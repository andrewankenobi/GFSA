            "revenue": "As a Seed stage startup with an MVP product, Noxon's revenue is likely minimal or non-existent. Revenue generation would depend on successful pilot programs, early customer adoption, or potential licensing agreements. More specific revenue figures are not publicly available.",
            "profitability": "Noxon is unlikely to be profitable at the Seed stage. The company is likely focused on product development, team building, and market validation, which typically involve significant expenses. Profitability would be a future goal dependent on scaling operations and achieving market penetration.",
            "burn_rate": "Specific burn rate information for Noxon is not publicly available. However, as a Seed stage startup with 14 employees and ongoing product development, the burn rate is likely significant. Key expense areas would include salaries, research and development, marketing, and operational costs. A rough estimate could be in the range of \u20ac50k-\u20ac100k per month, but this is speculative without concrete data.",
            "runway": "Given the \u20ac0.75M Seed funding, and assuming a monthly burn rate (estimated above), the runway could be between 7 and 15 months. This is highly dependent on the actual burn rate, which is not publicly available. The runway is a critical factor for Noxon to achieve key milestones such as securing pilot customers, demonstrating product-market fit, and raising further funding.",
            "financial_metrics": {
                "customer_acquisition_cost": "Not applicable at this early stage, as Noxon is likely focused on developing the MVP and securing initial pilot customers. CAC will become a relevant metric as they begin scaling their sales and marketing efforts.",
                "lifetime_value_of_customer": "Not applicable at this early stage due to the limited or non-existent customer base. LTV will become relevant as they establish a recurring revenue model and gather data on customer retention and usage.",
                "gross_margin": "Not applicable at this early stage, as Noxon is still in the product development phase and has not yet generated significant revenue. Gross margin will depend on the cost of manufacturing the wearable device and delivering the personalized treatment software.",
                "monthly_recurring_revenue": "Likely zero or negligible at this stage, as Noxon is still in the MVP phase and has not yet established a recurring revenue model. MRR will become a key metric as they transition to a subscription-based or usage-based pricing model for their personalized treatment software."
