            "product_description": "Noxon's core product is a Muscle-Computer Interface (MCI) designed to redefine muscle health through personalized treatments. It is a wearable technology aimed at addressing musculoskeletal and neuromuscular conditions such as muscle atrophy, imbalances, and Parkinson's disease. The device integrates Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES), Electromyography (EMG), and AI to provide 24/7 monitoring and treatment, seamlessly integrating with mobility aids and sportswear. The goal is to provide daily-use treatments that leverage muscle data to improve patient outcomes.",
