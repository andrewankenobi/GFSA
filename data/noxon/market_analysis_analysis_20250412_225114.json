            "target_market": "Individuals suffering from musculoskeletal and neuromuscular conditions, including muscle atrophy, imbalances, and conditions like Parkinson's disease. This includes both B2B (hospitals, rehabilitation centers, sports medicine clinics) and B2C (direct to consumer) markets.",
            "market_size": "The global market size for neuromuscular disease treatment is substantial and growing. Various reports estimate different figures, but all point to a multi-billion dollar market. For example, some reports estimate the global neuromuscular disease treatment market size to reach around $14 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of approximately 7-8% from 2023-2030. The specific market size for Noxon's wearable technology focusing on muscle health is more niche, but still represents a significant opportunity within the broader neuromuscular and musculoskeletal market. The WHO estimates 30% of people globally suffer from muscle health issues.",
            "growth_potential": "High. Several factors contribute to the growth potential: \n1.  Aging Population: The global population is aging, leading to an increased prevalence of age-related muscle disorders like sarcopenia and muscle atrophy.\n2.  Increasing Prevalence of Neuromuscular Diseases: Conditions like Parkinson's disease, muscular dystrophy, and spinal muscular atrophy are becoming more prevalent.\n3.  Technological Advancements: Advancements in wearable technology, AI, and NMES are creating new opportunities for personalized and effective treatments.\n4.  Growing Awareness: Increased awareness of muscle health and the importance of early intervention is driving demand for innovative solutions.\n5.  Demand for Personalized Treatment: There is a growing demand for personalized treatment options that can be tailored to individual needs and preferences.\n6. Sports and Rehabilitation: The application of Noxon's technology in sports performance enhancement and rehabilitation represents another significant growth area.",
