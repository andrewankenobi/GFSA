            "product_description": "Metsystem is developing a functional drug screening platform for cancer treatment. It utilizes patient-derived cancer organoids (PDCOs) to test drug responses on metastatic subpopulations of tumors. The platform employs AI-driven image analysis and automated seeding/imaging to enable large-scale drug screening and identify personalized treatments for cancer patients, particularly those with metastatic disease. The core value proposition is providing biomarker-independent drug response prediction across all solid tumors.",
