            "target_market": "Brands, AI development teams, creators, and organizations that own or utilize digital assets and intellectual property (IP). Specifically, companies in software, gaming, media, and other industries that rely on licensing content and data for AI training and monetization.",
            "market_size": "The market size is difficult to pinpoint exactly, but it encompasses several large and growing sectors. The global AI market is projected to reach trillions of dollars in the coming years, creating a substantial demand for high-quality data. The digital content licensing market is also significant, with substantial revenue generated annually. The intersection of these two markets, focusing on AI-driven data licensing, represents a considerable opportunity for V-Art. The specific size of the data licensing market for AI training is estimated to be in the billions and growing rapidly. Further breakdown includes the global AI market projected to reach $733.7 billion in 2027 (source: various market research reports). The digital content licensing market is also significant, estimated at tens of billions annually.",
            "growth_potential": "High. The demand for AI training data is increasing exponentially as AI models become more sophisticated and prevalent. The current inefficient licensing processes create a bottleneck, which V-Art aims to solve. The increasing focus on data privacy and compliance regulations also drives the need for solutions like V-Art that ensure secure and compliant data licensing. The growth potential is further fueled by the increasing volume of digital content being created and the desire of creators and brands to monetize their IP effectively. The rise of generative AI also creates a new demand for licensed datasets. The shift towards decentralized and blockchain-based solutions also aligns with V-Art's technology and offers further growth opportunities.",
