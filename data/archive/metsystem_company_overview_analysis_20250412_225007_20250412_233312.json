                "Raised 2M in pre-seed funding"
            ],
            "current_status": "Pre-seed stage startup with an MVP, actively seeking seed funding to accelerate impact in oncology and precision medicine. They are also working on streamlining their image analysis pipeline and optimizing their AI-powered drug screening platform. They are participating in an accelerator program to achieve these goals and gain visibility with VCs.",
            "unique_value_proposition": "Metsystem offers a functional drug screening platform utilizing patient-derived cancer organoids (PDCOs) to personalize cancer treatment. Their AI-driven approach enables high-resolution detection and drug response tracking, independent of biomarkers, across all solid tumors, potentially improving treatment outcomes for a larger percentage of patients than current precision medicine approaches."
