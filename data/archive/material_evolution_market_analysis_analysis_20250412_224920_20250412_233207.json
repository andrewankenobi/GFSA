            "target_market": "Construction companies, infrastructure developers, precast concrete manufacturers, government agencies involved in infrastructure projects, and organizations committed to sustainable building practices.",
            "market_size": "The global cement market is substantial. Reports indicate a market size of hundreds of billions of dollars, with forecasts projecting continued growth. For example, one source indicates a market size of approximately $373.48 billion in 2023, expected to reach $491.56 billion by 2032. The low-carbon cement and concrete market, specifically, is experiencing rapid growth due to increasing environmental regulations and demand for sustainable construction materials. Exact figures for the low-carbon segment vary, but growth rates are projected to be significant.",
            "growth_potential": "The growth potential is very high. Factors driving growth include increasing government regulations and incentives promoting low-carbon materials, growing awareness of the environmental impact of traditional cement, and increasing demand for sustainable infrastructure. The construction industry is under increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, creating a significant opportunity for companies like Material Evolution. Furthermore, the potential to repurpose industrial waste streams offers a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional cement production, further enhancing growth prospects.",
