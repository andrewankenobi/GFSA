            "burn_rate": "Specific burn rate information is not publicly available. Burn rate will depend on team size, marketing spend, technology infrastructure costs, and operational expenses. Given the team size of 4 (growing to 8 in Q2), the burn rate would be relatively moderate compared to larger startups.",
