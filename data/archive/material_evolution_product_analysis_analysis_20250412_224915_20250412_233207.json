            "product_description": "Material Evolution's primary product is MevoCem, a low-carbon cement alternative derived from industrial byproducts. It reduces CO2 emissions by up to 85% compared to traditional cement. The company also develops a Formulation Prediction Tool (FPT) that utilizes AI to analyze and optimize cement compositions, predicting compressive strength based on mineral feedstock and activator ratios with >90% accuracy. They are also working on carbon-negative products.",
