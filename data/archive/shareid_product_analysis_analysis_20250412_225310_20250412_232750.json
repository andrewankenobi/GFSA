            "product_description": "ShareID offers an Authentication-as-a-Service (AaaS) solution that focuses on real-time, privacy-first identity verification without storing personal or biometric data. It aims to replace traditional multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods with a more seamless and secure process. The core idea is to create a reusable digital identity linked to government-issued IDs. Users initially verify their identity through ID and face capture. Subsequent authentication is simplified to a real-time face verification (e.g., a smile), ensuring secure access and transactions without compromising privacy. ShareID targets businesses seeking to enhance user experience, improve security, and maintain compliance in online identity verification.",
