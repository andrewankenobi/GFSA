            "scaling_approach": "Metsystem's scaling approach is centered around leveraging its AI-powered platform and patient-derived cancer organoid (PDCO) technology. The key elements include:\n\n1.  **Technology Infrastructure:** Transitioning to BigQuery will be crucial for handling the large datasets generated by their high-resolution detection and AI-driven drug response tracking. Optimizing the image analysis pipeline on GCP will improve efficiency and throughput.\n\n2.  **Data Acquisition:** Expanding the collection of PDCOs is essential. This involves establishing partnerships with hospitals and research institutions to secure access to tumor samples.\n\n3.  **Automation:** The automated seeding and imaging processes are critical for large-scale application. Continuous improvement and optimization of these processes will be necessary to maintain efficiency as the number of PDCOs and drug screenings increases.\n\n4.  **Partnerships:** Strategic collaborations with pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, and clinical centers will be vital for validating the technology, expanding its reach, and accelerating adoption.\n\n5.  **Regulatory Compliance:** As Metsystem's technology moves closer to clinical application, ensuring compliance with relevant regulatory requirements (e.g., FDA in the US, EMA in Europe) will be paramount. This includes establishing robust quality control processes and data management systems.\n\n6.  **Team Expansion:** As the company scales, it will need to expand its team with expertise in areas such as data science, software engineering, biology, and business development.\n\n7.  **Funding:** Securing seed funding is a key priority. Subsequent funding rounds will be needed to support further development, expansion, and commercialization efforts."
