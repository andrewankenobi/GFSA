            "target_market": "Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, their caregivers, and healthcare professionals (specifically those involved in dementia care) in the UK and Europe, with plans for future global expansion. The B2B component targets healthcare providers (clinics, hospitals, care homes) while the B2B2C component addresses patients and caregivers through these providers.",
            "market_size": "The global Alzheimer's and dementia market is substantial and growing. Punto Health's documentation mentions the market costs $2.8 trillion annually. The number of people living with dementia worldwide is estimated to be 55 million, with nearly 10 million new cases every year (WHO). Statista projects the global dementia care market to reach hundreds of billions USD by 2030. In the UK alone, approximately 900,000 people are living with dementia (Alzheimer's Society UK).",
            "growth_potential": "The market has significant growth potential due to several factors: 1) Aging global population: The number of older adults, the demographic most susceptible to dementia, is increasing rapidly. 2) Increasing awareness and diagnosis: Improved diagnostic tools and greater awareness are leading to earlier and more accurate diagnoses. 3) Limited treatment options: The lack of effective cures for dementia drives demand for solutions that can manage symptoms, improve quality of life, and reduce caregiver burden. 4) Government initiatives: Governments worldwide are implementing national dementia strategies and investing in research and care, creating a supportive environment for innovative solutions like Punto Health. For example, the UK government has a National Dementia Strategy.",
