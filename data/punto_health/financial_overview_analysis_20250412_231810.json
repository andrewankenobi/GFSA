            "profitability": "Punto Health is not yet profitable. As a pre-launch, seed-stage company, profitability is a future goal dependent on successful product launch, market adoption, and efficient cost management.",
            "burn_rate": "Burn rate information is not publicly available. Determining Punto Health's burn rate would require access to their internal financial records. Factors influencing the burn rate include salaries, technology development costs, marketing expenses, and operational overhead.",
            "runway": "Runway information is not publicly available. Given the \u00a30.8M seed funding, the runway depends heavily on the burn rate. A rough estimate would require knowing the monthly expenses to determine how many months the current funding will last. The Google for Startups Accelerator program could potentially extend the runway by providing resources and mentorship to optimize spending.",

                "gross_margin": "Gross margin is currently projected and dependent on the pricing strategy and the cost of providing the service. Actual gross margin will be determined post-launch.",
