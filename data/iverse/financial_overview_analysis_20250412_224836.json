            "revenue": "As a Seed stage company founded in 2022, revenue information is likely not publicly available. Based on the information provided, iVerse has a fully launched product (EVA) and 7 employees, suggesting some revenue generation, but specific figures are unavailable.",
            "profitability": "Given the Seed stage and recent founding date (January 31, 2022), it is highly unlikely that iVerse is currently profitable. Seed funding is typically used for product development, market validation, and initial scaling, all of which precede profitability.",
            "burn_rate": "Burn rate information is not publicly available. As a startup, their burn rate will depend on factors like employee salaries, marketing expenses, infrastructure costs (hosting EVA), and other operational costs. A significant portion of the $2.5M seed funding is likely being used to cover these expenses.",
            "runway": "Runway information is not publicly available. The runway (the amount of time the company can operate before needing more funding) depends on their burn rate and remaining capital. Given the $2.5M seed funding, a typical startup runway might be 12-24 months, but this is highly speculative without knowing the burn rate.",
            "financial_metrics": {
                "customer_acquisition_cost": "Customer acquisition cost (CAC) data is not publicly available. CAC is a critical metric for B2B startups, reflecting the cost of acquiring a new customer. EVA's Al-driven interview process, if effective, could potentially lower CAC compared to traditional methods.",
                "lifetime_value": "Lifetime value (LTV) data is not publicly available. LTV is the predicted revenue a customer will generate during their relationship with the company. For iVerse, LTV will depend on the pricing model for EVA and the average customer lifespan.",
                "gross_margin": "Gross margin information is not publicly available. As a SaaS company, iVerse's gross margin should be relatively high, as the marginal cost of serving an additional customer is low once the platform is developed. However, this depends on infrastructure costs and customer support expenses.",
                "revenue_growth_rate": "Revenue growth rate data is not publicly available. As a young startup, iVerse is likely focused on rapid revenue growth, but specific figures are unavailable.",
                "cost_savings_for_clients": "The provided overview states that EVA reduces hiring costs by 52%. This is a key value proposition and a financial metric that iVerse likely tracks and uses in its marketing materials. This represents the direct financial benefit to clients using their product."
