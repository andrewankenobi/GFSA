            "target_market": "Construction companies, infrastructure developers, precast concrete manufacturers, and government agencies seeking to reduce their carbon footprint and utilize sustainable building materials. The initial focus is likely on the UK and Europe, with plans for global expansion.",
            "market_size": "The global cement market is substantial, estimated to be worth hundreds of billions of dollars annually. According to Statista, global cement production reached approximately 4.1 billion metric tons in 2023. The market for low-carbon cement alternatives is a growing segment within this larger market, driven by increasing environmental regulations and demand for sustainable construction practices. The market size for sustainable cement is expanding rapidly as companies and governments seek to reduce carbon emissions.",
            "growth_potential": "The growth potential for low-carbon cement alternatives like MevoCem is significant. The construction industry faces increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, with stricter environmental regulations and growing demand for sustainable building materials. The global push for net-zero emissions targets and the circular economy further fuels the demand for waste-derived, low-carbon cement. The market is expected to experience substantial growth in the coming years as adoption rates increase and production capacity expands. The increasing focus on sustainable infrastructure projects also contributes to the growth potential.",
