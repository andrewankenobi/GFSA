            "revenue_streams": [
                "Sale of MevoCem: The primary revenue stream is the sale of their low-carbon cement alternative, MevoCem, to construction companies and related industries.",
                "Licensing of Alkali Fusion Technology: Material Evolution could potentially license their patented alkali fusion technology to other cement manufacturers or construction material companies.",
                "Formulation Prediction Tool (FPT) as a Service: Offering their AI-driven Formulation Prediction Tool (FPT) as a subscription service or a per-use fee to companies seeking to optimize their cement formulations.",
                "Carbon Credits: Generating and selling carbon credits based on the reduced CO2 emissions achieved through the use of MevoCem compared to traditional cement."
            ],
            "pricing_strategy": "Likely a premium pricing strategy initially, justified by the significant reduction in carbon emissions and potential long-term cost savings for customers through reduced carbon taxes or incentives. The pricing will need to be competitive with traditional cement, considering the added value of sustainability. Volume discounts for large construction projects are also probable.",
            "customer_acquisition": "Targeting construction companies, infrastructure developers, government agencies involved in construction projects, and companies seeking to reduce their carbon footprint. Customer acquisition strategies likely include: direct sales, participation in industry trade shows (e.g., UK Construction Week), online marketing (LinkedIn, industry-specific publications), partnerships with construction material suppliers, and pilot projects to demonstrate the effectiveness of MevoCem.",
            "partnerships": [
                "Industrial Waste Producers: Partnerships with companies that generate industrial byproducts (e.g., steel slag, fly ash) to secure a consistent and cost-effective supply of raw materials.",
                "Construction Material Suppliers: Collaborating with existing suppliers of cement and other construction materials to distribute MevoCem through established channels.",
                "Construction Companies: Partnering with construction companies for pilot projects and large-scale implementation of MevoCem.",
                "Government Agencies: Working with government agencies to promote the adoption of low-carbon construction materials and potentially secure funding or incentives.",
                "Technology Providers: Collaboration with technology companies to further develop and enhance their AI-driven Formulation Prediction Tool (FPT).",
                "Google: Partnership with Google to leverage their cloud architecture and advanced systems for the Formulation Prediction Tool (FPT)."
            ],
            "scaling_strategy": "The scaling strategy appears to involve a combination of expanding their own production capacity and potentially licensing their technology. Key elements include: Expanding their existing 120K tonne/year facility, building new facilities in strategic locations to serve key markets, securing long-term contracts with industrial waste producers to ensure a reliable supply of raw materials, and developing a robust sales and marketing team to drive adoption of MevoCem. Global scaling may involve licensing the alkali fusion technology to partners in different regions."
