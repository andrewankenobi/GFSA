            "product_description": "Material Evolution (Mevo) offers MevoCem, an ultra-low carbon cement alternative made from industrial byproducts. It utilizes patented alkali fusion technology and AI-driven innovation to produce a sustainable material that reduces CO2 emissions by up to 85% compared to traditional cement. The company also develops a Formulation Prediction Tool (FPT) that predicts compressive strength performance based on mineral feedstock composition and optimizes activator ratios with >90% accuracy. Mevo also aims to develop carbon-negative products.",
