            "target_market": "B2B, specifically targeting enterprises and organizations looking to improve employee communication skills, leadership development, sales training, and overall workplace performance. This includes HR departments, learning and development teams, and leadership training programs within companies of various sizes.",
            "market_size": "The market for corporate training, which includes communication skills training, is substantial. Some reports estimate the global corporate training market to be worth hundreds of billions of dollars. For example, one report projects the global corporate training market size to reach $497.27 billion by 2030. The portion of this market specifically addressable by Ambr AI, focusing on communication skills training through AI simulations, is a significant subset but difficult to quantify precisely without more granular data. The problem Ambr AI addresses, poor workplace communication, is estimated to cost organizations $2 trillion annually.",
            "growth_potential": "The growth potential is high due to several factors. Firstly, the increasing recognition of the importance of effective communication in the workplace is driving demand for training solutions. Secondly, the rise of remote and hybrid work models necessitates stronger communication skills for virtual collaboration. Thirdly, advancements in AI and VR/AR technologies are making communication skills training more accessible, engaging, and effective. The corporate training market, in general, is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. Also, there is an increasing focus on soft skills training as automation takes over routine tasks.",
