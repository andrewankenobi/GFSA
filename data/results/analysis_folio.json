While a precise, verified figure specifically for the 'complex industrial products' segment is difficult to pinpoint, projections indicate hundreds of billions of dollars annually. The overall manufacturing software market size is projected to reach significant figures in the coming years. For example, one report projects the manufacturing software market to reach $29.48 Billion in 2032. However, this is a broader category than Folio's specific focus. Therefore, a more precise figure requires further segmentation and analysis. The market size specifically addressable by Folio is likely a significant portion of the overall manufacturing software market, focusing on companies requiring better sales enablement tools and AI-powered solutions for complex product information.",
