            "target_market": "Hospitals, diagnostic labs, pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, and healthcare providers who generate, process, and utilize clinical diagnostics and health data. Specifically, organizations struggling with data interoperability, standardization, and accessibility issues.",
            "market_size": "The global healthcare data interoperability market is experiencing substantial growth. Reports suggest a market size in the billions of USD, with projections for continued expansion. Specific numbers vary across reports, but generally indicate a significant market opportunity. For example, some reports estimate the global healthcare interoperability market size to reach approximately $10-15 billion by 2027-2028, growing at a CAGR of 10-15% from 2020. The European market, where Circular-Lab is based, also represents a significant portion of this global market.",
            "growth_potential": "High. The increasing adoption of electronic health records (EHRs), the growing need for data-driven decision-making in healthcare, and regulatory initiatives promoting interoperability (e.g., in the US and Europe) are driving market growth. The shift towards personalized medicine and the increasing volume of diagnostic data generated are also contributing factors. The need to efficiently manage and analyze this data creates significant growth potential for companies like Connect by Circular-Lab.",
