Pricing details were not publicly available. B2B pricing likely involves custom agreements based on the scope of data and personalization services provided.",
            "customer_acquisition": "Primarily through organic marketing, social media campaigns (Instagram, TikTok), content marketing (blog posts, styling guides), and app store optimization (ASO).
