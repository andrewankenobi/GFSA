            "target_market": "Businesses requiring secure and seamless identity verification for their customers, particularly those operating in regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, e-commerce, and government services. Specifically targets companies struggling with balancing user experience, security, and compliance in their MFA processes.",
            "market_size": "The digital identity verification market is substantial and growing rapidly. Estimates vary, but multiple sources suggest a global market size in the billions of USD, projected to reach tens of billions by 2030. Specific figures depend on the scope included (e.g., biometrics, document verification, etc.). The Authentication-as-a-Service (AaaS) market is also experiencing significant growth, driven by the need for scalable and cost-effective authentication solutions.",
            "growth_potential": "High. Several factors contribute to the growth potential: 1) Increasing online fraud and cybercrime necessitate stronger authentication measures. 2) Growing regulatory compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, KYC/AML) drive demand for robust identity verification solutions. 3) The expansion of e-commerce and digital services creates a greater need for secure online transactions. 4) Rising consumer expectations for seamless and secure user experiences fuel the adoption of innovative authentication methods like those offered by ShareID. 5) Increased focus on privacy-preserving technologies boosts the adoption of solutions that minimize data storage.",
