            "product_description": "Folio's AI platform transforms complex technical information from manufacturers and distributors (product specs, catalogs, aftermarket data) into user-friendly interfaces for sales teams and industrial buyers. It aims to bridge the gap between engineering expertise and sales tools, enhancing customer experience and driving business growth by simplifying the communication of technical details and business value in the complex manufacturing sales process.",
            "core_features": [
                "AI-powered data ingestion of technical specs, customer requirements, and aftermarket service details.",
                "Automatic generation of clear, tailored sales and marketing materials.",
                "User-friendly interface for sales teams and industrial buyers.",
                "Integration with existing CRM and ERP systems (inferred, not explicitly stated but likely).",
                "Personalized product configurations based on customer needs.",
                "Improved communication of technical details and business value.",
                "Enhanced customer experience through simplified buying process."

            "technology_stack": [
                "AI/ML (likely using NLP and potentially computer vision for document processing).",
                "Cloud-based platform (likely AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure).",
                "API integrations for CRM and ERP systems.",
                "Frontend framework for user interface (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js).",

            "development_stage": "MVP. Folio is at the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage, indicating that they have a functional product with core features that they are testing and iterating on with early customers. The fact that they are in the Google for Startups Accelerator: AI First program suggests they are actively working to improve and scale their AI capabilities.",
            "user_feedback": "Currently, direct user feedback is not publicly available. However, the problem Folio is addressing (complexity in manufacturing sales) is a well-known pain point. Positive user feedback would likely focus on ease of use, time savings, improved sales effectiveness, and better customer engagement. Negative feedback might revolve around data accuracy, integration challenges with existing systems, and the need for more customization options.",
            "product_roadmap": [
                "Further development and refinement of AI algorithms for improved data ingestion and material generation.",
