            "market_size": "The global B2B e-commerce market, which includes industrial products, is substantial. While a precise, verified figure specifically for the 'complex industrial products' segment is difficult to pinpoint, projections indicate hundreds of billions of dollars annually. The overall manufacturing software market size is projected to reach significant figures in the coming years. For example, one report projects the manufacturing software market to reach $29.48 Billion in 2032. However, this is a broader category than Folio's specific focus. Therefore, a more precise figure requires further segmentation and analysis. The market size specifically addressable by Folio is likely a significant portion of the overall manufacturing software market, focusing on companies requiring better sales enablement tools and AI-powered solutions for complex product information.",
            "growth_potential": "The market demonstrates strong growth potential. Several factors contribute to this: 1) Digital Transformation in Manufacturing: The manufacturing sector is undergoing significant digital transformation, driving demand for solutions that improve efficiency and customer experience. 2) AI Adoption: Increased adoption of AI in sales and marketing is creating opportunities for AI-powered platforms like Folio. 3) Complexity of Industrial Products: The inherent complexity of industrial products necessitates specialized tools for sales and marketing. 4) E-commerce Growth: The continued growth of B2B e-commerce creates a need for solutions that can effectively manage and present complex product information online. 5) The need for personalized customer experiences is also driving growth.
