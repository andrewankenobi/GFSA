            "pricing_strategy": "Likely a tiered pricing model for lenders, based on usage volume (number of assessments) or features accessed. Could also involve a combination of subscription and per-assessment fees. The pricing strategy for potential premium B2C services is currently unknown.",
            "customer_acquisition": "Focus on acquiring lenders as B2B clients through direct sales, industry events, and partnerships with financial institutions.

            "scaling_strategy": "Expand the platform's reach to more lenders in the UK and potentially internationally. Develop new features and services to enhance the platform's value proposition for both lenders and borrowers. Invest in AI and machine learning to improve the accuracy and personalization of the platform. Potentially explore partnerships with larger financial institutions or technology companies to accelerate growth. Address regulatory compliance in different jurisdictions to facilitate international expansion. Initially focused on the UK market, with plans for future expansion based on success and regulatory considerations."
