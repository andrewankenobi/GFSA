            "target_market": "Individuals in the UK with limited or poor credit history, particularly those underserved by traditional credit scoring methods. This includes individuals with thin credit files, those new to the UK, gig economy workers, and others who may be financially excluded due to lack of traditional credit data. Lenders (banks, credit unions, fintech companies) seeking to improve their lending decisions, reduce risk, and expand their customer base by safely lending to a broader range of individuals are also a key part of the target market.",
            "market_size": "In the UK, approximately 16.2 million people are misjudged for credit due to limited credit score data. This represents a significant portion of the adult population and highlights the potential market size for alternative credit scoring solutions like Good With. The total addressable market (TAM) also includes the broader market of lenders seeking to improve their credit risk assessment processes and expand their lending portfolios. The UK lending market is substantial, with billions of pounds lent annually across various credit products (personal loans, mortgages, credit cards, etc.).",
            "growth_potential": "The market has significant growth potential driven by several factors: \n1.  Increasing adoption of Open Banking: Open Banking is gaining traction in the UK, providing Good With with greater access to consumer financial data. This trend is expected to continue, fueling the growth of Open Banking-powered solutions.\n2.  Rising demand for financial inclusion: There is a growing awareness of the need for financial inclusion and fair access to credit. This is driven by social and economic factors, as well as regulatory pressure on lenders to serve underserved populations.\n3.  Advancements in AI and data analytics: AI and machine learning technologies are becoming increasingly sophisticated, enabling more accurate and personalized credit risk assessment. This allows companies like Good With to develop innovative solutions that can better predict creditworthiness.\n4.  Regulatory support: The UK government and regulatory bodies like the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) are actively promoting innovation in the financial services sector and encouraging the use of alternative credit data.\n5. Changing employment landscape: The rise of the gig economy and non-traditional employment models creates a growing segment of individuals with non-standard income streams, making it harder for them to access credit using traditional methods.",
