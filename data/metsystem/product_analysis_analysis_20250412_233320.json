            "product_description": "Metsystem offers a functional drug screening platform that utilizes patient-derived cancer organoids (PDCOs) to identify personalized cancer treatments. The platform aims to address the limitations of traditional cancer treatments by accounting for genetic differences and drug resistance, particularly in metastatic cases. It involves isolating metastatic subpopulations, cultivating over 1,000 PDCOs, and using AI-driven image analysis to track drug responses and automate the screening process. The goal is to provide clinicians with biomarker-independent data to select the most effective treatments for individual patients.",
